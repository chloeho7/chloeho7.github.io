UNDER CONSTRUCTION WORK IN PROGRESS

Hi! I'm Chloe Ho, a senior at Barnard College studying computer science. My interests and passions include software engineering, research, education, and tech equity. I enjoy working with passionate teams on projects that promote public well-being and align with my values. I have previous experience working in software engineering, fintech, research, and teaching.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
