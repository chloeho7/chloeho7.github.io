  abstract = {Computer science (CS) and engineering research both have large and well-documented gender diversity gaps [1] , [2] , [3] . In fact, previous studies have reported that the overall CS female author ratio (FAR) is only in the range of 16%–26% [1] , [3] , [4] . As shown in Table 1 , recent evidence shows that this number varies significantly among CS subfields, ranging from as high as 42% in CS education to as low as 8% in theory and algorithms [1] , [4] . Furthermore, while recent work has shown that the diversity in conference leadership has increased substantially over recent years [5] and that the state of gender diversity in marine robotics ranges from 7% to 44% across various countries in Europe [6] , there has not been a comprehensive study analyzing the current state of gender diversity across the broader overall field of robotics.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
